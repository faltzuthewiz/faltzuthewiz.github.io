                    </div>
                    <p>My name is Sonja, also known as faltzu. I am a Finnish business IT student and this is my
                        portfolio site.</p>
                    <p>I started my journey to become a software developer in the beginning of 2021. I was a fairly
                        fresh Management Assistant graduate (my major was 'meetings and events'. I graduated a couple
                        months after the pandemic started. "Yippee!") and I had been working as an assistant for a few
                        years. I
                        had realized that my true passion involves technology, always has. I attended some online
                        courses and did the exercises whenever I could while having a fulltime job. In 2021–2022 I was
                        volunteering as a mobile app developer for <a href="https://scouts.fi">the Finnish Scouts
                            Association</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the spring 2022 I quit my
                        job as an assistant, so I could focus on studying IT. I decided to get a bachelor's degree from
                        the field of IT in Haaga-Helia
                        University of Applied Sciences - the very
                        same place where I got my first BBA degree.</p>
                    <p>I am majoring in software development, but I have also been doing some courses related to
                        networks, information security, software testing and AI. My target to graduate is in 2025.
                    </p>
                    <p>Combining studies and work has not been always easy, but I have been able to get experience from
                        different IT jobs while studying. In my first semester in
                        2022, I
                        had a short internship as a web developer, when I
                        built a <a href="https://tki.fi">TKI.fi website</a> for Arene – the Rectors' Conference of
                        Finnish
                        Universities of Applied Sciences with WordPress Elementor. I have worked in IT Help Desk in
                        summer 2023. The next summer I worked in the IT Department of HUS, the biggest healtcare
                        provider in Finland, as a application engineer intern.</p>
                    <p>In free time, I love reading comics and spending time in the nature. I also love playing and
                        learning about video games, and especially watching other people play old Nintendo games. One of
                        my
                        passions has been
                        developing alcohol-free student culture and that's why I
                        started <a href="https://helga.fi/en/services/club-activities/">a geek student club</a> when I
                        studied my first degree.</p>
                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most of my coding experience is in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I have used these in
                            my own projects,
                            at school and in two work projects.</li>
                        <li>I have been studying Java and SQL in Haaga-Helia UAS. For example I made a board game site
                            as a back end course project with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. My completed training projects
                            are found on GitHub.</li>
                        <li>Currently I'm learning Full Stack Development with React and Node.js. I am using the course
                            materials provided by the <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">University of
                                Helsinki</a>.</li>
                        <li>I have also used a little bit of C# and Python. I have used C# in simple games made with
                            Unity. My dream is to make a indie game on my own. I have used Python in a course called
                            "The Basics of Data Analytics".</li>
                        <li>A few highlights from my previous work tasks: I have handled data, done requirement
                            specification & documented and reported my findings.</li>
                        <li>As I mentioned before, I used to be an assistant. So you know, the languages I know are
                            not related to just programming. I can communicate well with Finnish and English,
                            and somewhat in Swedish and German. I also understand business, time-management,
                            prioritizing, teamwork etc...</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Plans for the future</h2>
                    <p>I would like to get a job in the field of IT as soon as possible, since the best way to learn for
                        me is hands-on experience. Since I am about to graduate soon, I am
                        looking for long-term commitment opportunities from my next job!
                    </p>
                    <p>My long-time plans are becoming a ICT professional, publishing a comic and owning a summer
                        cottage in the countryside.</p>
